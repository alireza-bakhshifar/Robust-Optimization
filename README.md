# Robust-Optimization
Robust Optimization is a technique used to tackle uncertainty, alongside Stochastic Optimization and Fuzzy Optimization. The latter techniques have deficiencies that can be addressed by Robust Optimization. To apply R.O., only the bounds of the uncertain parameters are needed.
